# MongoDB C++ Driver [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/legacy.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver)
Welcome to the MongoDB C++ Driver!

Use this branch if:

 - You are using MongoDB's C++ driver for the first time.
 - You had been using 26compat (or the driver inside of the server source) and
 want to benefit from incremental improvements but have the same overall API.

Switch to the 26compat branch if:

 - You have existing code that used the driver from the server source
 and want it to continue working without modification.

**Please Note:** As of MongoDB 2.6.0-rc1, it is no longer possible to build the
driver from the server sources: this repository is the only approved source for
driver builds.

The master branch will contain future development work on a new driver with a
completely new API and implementation. It is a work in progress and currently
should not be used.

## Repository Overview

| Branch   | Development        | Purpose                                               |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| master   | Planning           | New C++ driver (work in progress)                     |
| legacy   | Active             | Existing C++ driver with non-compatible improvements  |
| 26compat | Maintenance Only   | Drop in replacement for users of existing C++ driver  |

## Components

  - `libmongoclient.[so|dylib|dll]` - The shared mongoclient library (but see notes)
  - `libmongoclient.a` - The static mongoclient library

## Building

  See http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/tutorial/download-and-compile-cpp-driver/

## Bugs and Issues

  See http://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CXX

## Notes

  Use of the shared library is experimental on windows and is currently
  discouraged. This is primarily due to the complexity of ensuring a matching
  implementation of STL types between library and consumer code. This problem
  is unique to windows, as the consistent use of system libraries largely
  mitigates this danger.
