Welcome to the MongoDB C++ Driver!

## Branches - `releases/stable` versus `master`

The default checkout branch of this repository is `releases/stable`. 
This will always contain the latest stable release of the driver. The
 `master` branch is used for active development. `master` should 
**only** be used when making contributions back to the driver, as it 
is not stable for use in production.

See [Driver Status by family and version](#driver-status-by-family-and-version)
for more details about the various versions of the driver.

## Driver status by family and version

Stability indicates whether this driver is recommended for production use.
Currently, no drivers guarantee API or ABI stability.

| Family/version       | Stability   | Development         | Purpose                             |
