## 3.9.0

### Added

- Document availability of on [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) and [Conan](https://conan.io/center/recipes/mongo-cxx-driver).
- Add CMake option `MONGOCXX_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_INSTALL_PREFIX` (default is `TRUE`
  for backwards-compatibility). If enabled, `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` defaults to the build directory.
- Add API to manage [Atlas Search Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/).
- Automatically download C driver dependency if not provided.
- Add VERSIONINFO resource to bsoncxx.dll and mongocxx.dll.

### Changed
- Do not build tests as part of `all` target. Configure with `BUILD_TESTING=ON` to build tests.
- Bump minimum required CMake version to 3.15 to support the FetchContent module and for consistency with the C Driver.
- Improve handling of downloaded (non-system) mnmlstc/core as the polyfill library.
  - Use `FetchContent` instead of `ExternalProject` to download and build the library.
  - Do not patch include directives in mnmlstc/core headers.
- Bump minimum C Driver version to [1.25.0](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/tag/1.25.0).

### Fixed
- Explicitly document that throwing an exception from an APM callback is undefined behavior.
- Do not prematurely install mnmlstc/core headers during the CMake build step.
- Require a C Driver CMake package is found via `find_dependency()` for all installed CXX Driver package configurations.

### Removed
- Remove support for exported targets from the CMake project build tree.
- Drop support for the following operating systems:
