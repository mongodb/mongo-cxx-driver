## 3.11.0

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the final v3 minor release. Patch releases containing backports for relevant bug fixes will be supported for up to one year after the first v4 release. New features will not be backported.

### Added

- Support for MongoDB Server version 8.0.
- Stable support for In-Use Encryption Range Indexes.
- Documentation of the [API and ABI versioning and compatibility policy](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/cpp/cpp-driver/current/api-abi-versioning/).
- API documentation pages for directories, files, namespaces, and root namespace redeclarations.
- `empty()` member function for `mongocxx::v_noabi::bulk_write`.

### Fixed

- GCC 4.8.5 (RHEL 7) compatibility issues.
  - Redeclaration error due to `bsoncxx::v_noabi::stdx::basic_string_view<...>::npos`.
  - User-defined literal syntax error due to `bsoncxx::v_noabi::operator"" _bson(const char*, size_t)`.
- MSVC 17.11 compatibility issue due to missing `<string>` include directives.
- `bsoncxx::v_noabi::to_json` error handling given invalid BSON documents.
- Client pool error handling on wait queue timeout per `waitQueueTimeoutMS`.

### Changed

- Bump the minimum required C Driver version to [1.28.0](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/tag/1.28.0).
- Declare all exported function symbols with `__cdecl` when compiled with MSVC.
  - This does not affect users who compile with MSVC's default calling convention.
  - This is an ABI breaking change for users who use an alternative default calling convention when building their projects (e.g. with `/Gz`, `/Gv`, etc.). See [Argument Passing and Naming Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/argument-passing-and-naming-conventions) for more information.
- `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()` is used to populate dependencies instead of `FetchContent_Populate()` for the C Driver (when not provided by `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`) and mnmlstc/core (when automatically selected or when `BSONCXX_POLY_USE_MNMLSTC=ON`).
  - Note: `FetchContent_Populate()` is still used for mnmlstc/core for CMake versions prior to 3.18 to avoid `add_subdirectory()` behavior.
- Test suite now uses Catch2 v3 via FetchContent instead of the bundled Catch2 v2 standalone header.
  - C++14 or newer is required to build tests when enabled with `ENABLE_TESTS=ON`.
  - Set `ENABLE_TESTS=OFF` to avoid the C++14 requirement when building C++ Driver libraries.

### Deprecated

- The `bsoncxx/util/functor.hpp` header.
- The `bsoncxx::util` namespace.

### Removed

- Support for MongoDB Server 3.6 (due to the minimum required C Driver version).
  - See: [MongoDB Software Lifecycle Schedules](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles).
  - See: [MongoDB C Driver 1.28.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/tag/1.28.0).
- Export of private member functions in the bsoncxx ABI:
  - `bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::value::value(const uint8_t*, uint32_t, uint32_t, uint32_t)`
  - `bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::_init(void*)`
  - `bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::view(const uint8_t*, uint32_t, uint32_t, uint32_t)`
  - `bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::view(void*)`
- Export of private member functions in the mongocxx ABI:
  - `mongocxx::v_noabi::options::change_stream::as_bson()`
  - `mongocxx::v_noabi::options::aggregate::append(bsoncxx::v_noabi::builder::basic::document&)`
  - `mongocxx::v_noabi::options::index::storage_options()`

## 3.10.2

### Added

- SSDLC Compliance Report and related release artifacts.

### Fixed

- Undefined behavior when moving a `mongocxx::v_noabi::events::topology_description::server_descriptions` object due to uninitialized data member access.

## 3.10.1

### Fixed

- (MSVC only) The name of the libbsoncxx package in the "Requires" field of the libmongocxx pkg-config file incorrectly used the library output name instead of the pkg-config package name when `ENABLE_ABI_TAG_IN_PKGCONFIG_FILENAMES=OFF`.
- (MSVC only) The translation of the `MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` target property into an ABI tag parameter in library and package filenames did not account for generator expressions.

## 3.10.0

### Added

- Forward headers providing non-defining declarations of bsoncxx and mongocxx class types.
  - Note: user-defined forward declarations of any library entity has not been, and is still not, supported.
    To obtain the declaration or definition of a library entity, always include the corresponding header.
- The CMake option `ENABLE_BSONCXX_USE_POLY_IMPLS` (OFF by default) allows selecting bsoncxx implementations of C++17 polyfills by default when no polyfill library is requested.
- The CMake option `BSONCXX_POLY_USE_IMPLS` (OFF by default) allows selecting bsoncxx implementations of C++17 polyfills instead of external libraries or the C++ standard library.

### Changed

- The `bsoncxx::v_noabi` and `mongocxx::v_noabi` namespaces are no longer declared `inline`.
  - This change is *not* expected to break source or binary compatibility, but is nevertheless documented here due to its significance. If this change does inadvertently break source or binary compatibility, please submit a bug report.
  - Root namespace declarations are still supported and expected to remain equivalent to their prior definitions (e.g. `bsoncxx::document` is still equivalent to `bsoncxx::v_noabi::document`, `mongocxx::client` is still equivalent to `mongocxx::v_noabi::client`, etc.). Argument-dependent lookup and template instantiations are expected to remain equivalent to their prior behavior.
  - Note: user-defined forward declarations of any library entity has not been, and is still not, supported.
    To obtain the declaration or definition of a library entity, always include the corresponding header.
- Library filenames, when compiled with MSVC (as detected by [CMake's MSVC variable](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.15/variable/MSVC.html)), are now embedded with an ABI tag string, e.g. `bsoncxx-v_noabi-rhs-x64-v142-md.lib`.
  - This new behavior is enabled by default; disable by setting `ENABLE_ABI_TAG_IN_LIBRARY_FILENAMES=OFF` when configuring the CXX Driver.
  - The ABI tag string can also be embedded in pkg-config metadata filenames, e.g. `libbsoncxx-v_noabi-rhs-x64-v142-md.pc`. This is disabled by default; enable by setting `ENABLE_ABI_TAG_IN_PKGCONFIG_FILENAMES=ON` (requires `ENABLE_ABI_TAG_IN_LIBRARY_FILENAMES=ON`).

### Removed

- Deprecated CMake package config files.
  - `find_package(libbsoncxx)` and `find_package(libmongocxx)` are no longer supported.
    Use `find_package(bsoncxx)` and `find_package(mongocxx)` instead.
  - Accordingly, `LIBBSONCXX_*` and `LIBMONGOCXX_*` CMake variables provided by the legacy CMake package config files are no longer supported. Use the `mongo::bsoncxx_*` and `mongo::mongocxx_*` CMake targets instead.
  - Note: manually setting compile definitions, include directories, and link libraries is unnecessary with target-based CMake. The former `LIBBSONCXX_*` and `LIBMONGOCXX_*` CMake variables are superseded by the `target_link_libraries()` CMake command, which automatically propagates the necessary compile definitions, include directories, and link libraries to dependent targets via `mongo::bsoncxx_*` and `mongo::mongocxx_*` interface properties.
- Experimental C++ standard library as a polyfill option via `BSONCXX_POLY_USE_STD_EXPERIMENTAL`.

## 3.9.0

### Added

- The C++ driver container image is now available on [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver).
- Document availability of on [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) and [Conan](https://conan.io/center/recipes/mongo-cxx-driver).
- Add CMake option `MONGOCXX_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_INSTALL_PREFIX` (default is `TRUE`
  for backwards-compatibility). If enabled, `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` defaults to the build directory.
- Add API to manage [Atlas Search Indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/).
- Automatically download C driver dependency if not provided.
- Add VERSIONINFO resource to bsoncxx.dll and mongocxx.dll.

### Changed

- Do not build tests as part of `all` target. Configure with `BUILD_TESTING=ON` to build tests.
- Bump minimum required CMake version to 3.15 to support the FetchContent module and for consistency with the C Driver.
- Improve handling of downloaded (non-system) mnmlstc/core as the polyfill library.
  - Use `FetchContent` instead of `ExternalProject` to download and build the library.
  - Do not patch include directives in mnmlstc/core headers.
- Bump minimum C Driver version to [1.25.0](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/tag/1.25.0).

### Fixed

- Explicitly document that throwing an exception from an APM callback is undefined behavior.
- Do not prematurely install mnmlstc/core headers during the CMake build step.
- Require a C Driver CMake package is found via `find_dependency()` for all installed CXX Driver package configurations.

### Removed

- Remove support for exported targets from the CMake project build tree.
- Drop support for the following operating systems:
  - macOS 10.14 and 10.15
  - Ubuntu 14.04
