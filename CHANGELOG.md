## 3.9.0 [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add CMake option `MONGOCXX_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_INSTALL_PREFIX` (default is `TRUE`
  for backwards-compatibility).
- Add API to manage Atlas Search Indexes.
- Automatically download C driver dependency if not provided.

### Changed
- Do not build tests as part of `all` target. Configure with `BUILD_TESTING=ON` to build tests.
- Bump minimum required CMake version to 3.15 to support the FetchContent module and for consistency with the C Driver.
- Improve handling of downloaded (non-system) mnmlstc/core as the polyfill library.
  - Use `FetchContent` instead of `ExternalProject` to download and build the library.
  - Do not patch include directives in mnmlstc/core headers.

### Fixed
- Explicitly document that throwing an exception from an APM callback is undefined behavior.
- Do not prematurely install mnmlstc/core headers during the CMake build step.
- Require a C Driver CMake package is found via `find_dependency()` for all installed CXX Driver package configurations.

### Removed
- Remove support for exported targets from the CMake project build tree.
