/// init(), flag_init(), or init_from_static() are called during a scoped_bson_t's lifetime

/// Initialization of a scoped bson_t depends on how it is expected to be used.

/// should be called after such use. If this bson_t will be used by a function that does
/// not call init itself (expecting an already initialized bson_t) then init() could be called
