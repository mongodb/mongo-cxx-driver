/// A class to represent the read concern. Read concern can be set at the client, database, or
/// collection level. The read concern can also be provided via connection string, and will be
/// parsed and set on the client constructed for the URI.
///
/// For the WiredTiger storage engine, MongoDB 3.2 introduced the readConcern option for replica
/// sets and replica set shards. The readConcern option allows clients to choose a level of
/// isolation for their reads. You can specify a readConcern of "majority" to read data that has
/// been written to a majority of nodes and thus cannot be rolled back. By default, MongoDB uses a
/// readConcern of "local" which does not guarantee that the read data would not be rolled back.
///
/// MongoDB 3.4 introduces a read concern level of "linearizable" to read data that has been written
/// to a majority of nodes (i.e. cannot be rolled back) @b and is not stale. Linearizable read
/// concern is available for all MongoDB supported storage engines and applies to read operations on
/// a single document. Note that writes must be made with majority write concern in order for reads
/// to be linearizable.
