/// Class representing the server-side requirement for reporting the success of a write
/// operation. The strength of the write concern setting determines the level of guarantees
/// that you will receive from MongoDB regarding write durability.
///
/// Weaker requirements that provide fewer guarantees report on success quickly while stronger
/// requirements that provide greater guarantees will take longer (or potentially forever, if
/// the write_concern's requirements are not satisfied and no timeout is set).
///
/// MongoDB drivers allow for different levels of write concern to better address the specific
/// needs of applications. Clients may adjust write concern to ensure that the most important
/// operations persist successfully to an entire MongoDB deployment. However, for other less
/// critical operations, clients can adjust the write concern to ensure better performance
/// rather than persistence to the entire deployment.
