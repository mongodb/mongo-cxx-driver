     * Class for constructing and executing bulk operations against MongoDB via a
     * fluent API.
     *
     * Example Usage:
     *
     * BulkOperationBuilder bulk(...);
     * bulk.insert(<BSONObj>);
     * bulk.insert(<BSONObj>);
     * bulk.find(<BSONObj>).updateOne(<BSONObj>);
     *
     * vector<BSONObj> results;
     * bulk.execute(<WriteConcern>, &results);
     *
     * Usually not instantiated directly, instead it usually comes into being via
     * the following DBClientBase methods:
     *
     *      initializeOrderedBulkOperation()
     *      intiializeUnorderedBulkOperation()
     *
     * The class is able to optimize unordered operations by grouping similar ones
     * into batches instead of sending them individually to the server. This means
     * that unordered writes are non-deterministic. This is by design.
