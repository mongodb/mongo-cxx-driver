   Main include file for C++ BSON. This pulls in fewer dependencies than
   mongo/client/dbclient.h, but still requires libmongoclient to link.

   "BSON" stands for "binary JSON" -- ie a binary way to represent objects that would be
   represented in JSON (plus a few extensions useful for databases & other languages).
