     * Logging domain for events of type E.
     *
     * A logging domain consists of a set of Appenders and a minimum severity.
     *
     * TODO: The severity doesn't seem to apply for auditing, maybe it only belongs on the
     * MessageLogManager?  We don't really have multiple tunable logging domains, right now.  Other
     * than the global domain, shouldLog doesn't matter.
     *
     * Usage: Configure the log domain in a single threaded context, using attachAppender,
     * detachAppender and clearAppenders().  The domain takes ownership of any attached appender,
     * returning an AppenderHandle for each attached appender.  That handle may be used later to
     * detach the appender, causing the domain to release ownership of it.  Mostly, this
     * attach/detach behavior is useful in testing, since you do not want to change the appenders of
     * a domain that is currently receiving append() calls.
     *
     * Once you've configured the domain, call append() from potentially many threads, to add log
     * messages.
