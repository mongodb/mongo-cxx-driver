/// Class representing a preference for how the driver routes read operations to members of a
/// replica set or to a sharded cluster.
///
/// By default read operations are directed to the primary member in a replica set. Reading from the
/// primary guarantees that read operations reflect the latest version of a document. However, by
/// distributing some or all reads to secondary members of the replica set, you can improve read
/// throughput or reduce latency for an application that does not require fully up-to-date data.
///
/// Read preference can be broadly specified by setting a mode. It is also possible to
/// set tags in the read preference for more granular control, and to target specific members of a
/// replica set via attributes other than their current state as a primary or secondary node.
///
/// Read preferences are ignored for direct connections to a single mongod instance. However,
/// in order to perform read operations on a direct connection to a secondary member of a replica
/// set, you must set a read preference that allows reading from secondaries.
