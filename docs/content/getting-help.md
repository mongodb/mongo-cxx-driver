Often, the quickest way to get support for general questions is through
the
[MongoDB Community Forums](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/tag/cxx)
or through
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb%20c%2b%2b).

Please also refer to MongoDB's
[support channels](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/support) documentation.
