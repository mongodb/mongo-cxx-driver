# Releasing the mongocxx driver

**NOTE**: To follow these instructions, be very careful which branch you're
working on:

* Version bump/tag/post-bump commits go on the branch corresponding to the release.
* Documentation updates go on the `master` branch.

The instructions below will remind you about branches.

## Update fixVersion Status in Jira tickets

* Ensure that all tickets under the version to be released are in
  'Closed' status on the C++ Driver [roadmap
  page](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CXX/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:roadmap-panel)
* If not, bulk change **Open** tickets that will **NOT** be in the release to a new
  version (create it if necessary):

## Audit Jira ticket titles and types for use in release notes

* From the [roadmap page](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CXX/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:roadmap-panel)
  click the "Release Notes" link to see a summary of tickets to be included
  in release notes.
* Update the ticket type and title as appropriate.  User-facing issues
  should generally be either "Bug" or "New Feature".  Non-user facing
  issues should generally be "Task" tickets (and will be omitted later, so
  you can ignore them here).

## Create a BUMP commit

This commit essentially removes the -pre (e.g. 1.0.0-rc79-pre ->
1.0.0-rc79) and creates what is considered the final commit in the release.

*  If you haven't already, clone the mongodb-cxx-driver repository

```
git clone git@github.com:mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.git
cd mongo-cxx-driver
```

* Otherwise, pull the latest code down from the origin with `git pull`
* Checkout the branch corresponding to the release
* Update the following files (changing version numbers to remove the "-pre"
  for the MONGOCXX_VERSION_EXTRA and BSONCXX_VERSION_EXTRA variables):
    * [`src/mongocxx/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/blob/master/src/mongocxx/CMakeLists.txt#L30)
    * [`src/bsoncxx/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/blob/master/src/bsoncxx/CMakeLists.txt#L22)
* Commit with message "BUMP rx.y.z[-rcq]", e.g.:

```
git commit -am "BUMP r3.0.1"
git push origin <release-branch>
```

Pushing the BUMP commit to the origin will kick off builds in Evergreen
and Travis CI. Wait for both builds to finish and pass, re-running any
timeout/spot failures.

Meanwhile, test the branch locally.

## Tag the Release

* Create an tag for the commit that will serve as the release (or release candidate), eg:

```
git tag r3.0.1
git push origin r3.0.1
```

## Draft & Publish GitHub Release Notes

* Go to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/releases).
* Copy the previous announcement text for reuse.
* Click "Draft a New Release" and set the title and tag.  Check the
  "This is a pre-release" checkbox if appropriate.
* Paste the previous announcement and modify with release-specific information
    * Go back to the "Release Notes" page in Jira; copy the HTML and paste it into
      the GitHub Release Notes markdown.  Delete the "Task" section and any
      other information that doesn't need to be in the release notes.
* Preview the release text and proofread it.
* Publish the release.

## Release the Version in Jira

* Go
  [here](https://jira.mongodb.org/plugins/servlet/project-config/CXX/versions)
* Click the cog next to the version you are about to release and select "Release"
* Follow the dialogs/wizards and whatnot, setting the release date to the current date
* If the next version does not exist, create it.  E.g.:
    * If releasing 3.1.1, create 3.2.2.
    * If releasing 3.4.0-rc0, create 3.4.0-rc1.
    * If releasing 3.4.0, create 3.4.1 **and** 3.5.0-rc0.

## Create the Next Version commit

* Make sure you're on the branch corresponding to the release.
* Update the following files (changing version numbers to bump to the next version number and add the "-pre" suffix for the MONGOCXX_VERSION_EXTRA and BSONCXX_VERSION_EXTRA variables):
    * [`src/mongocxx/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/blob/master/src/mongocxx/CMakeLists.txt#L30)
    * [`src/bsoncxx/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/blob/master/src/bsoncxx/CMakeLists.txt#L22)
* Commit with message "post rx.y.z[-rcq]", e.g.:

```
git commit -am "post r3.0.1"
git push origin <release-branch>
```

## Possibly update the releases/stable branch

We use the `releases/stable` branch to track the best 'stable' release for
users who install from the git repository.

After any stable release (i.e. not an alpha, beta, RC, etc. release), check
out the `releases/stable` branch, reset it to the new release tag, and
force push it to the repo. E.g.:

```
git checkout releases/stable
git reset --hard r3.0.1
git push -f origin releases/stable
```

## Generate and Publish Documentation

Documentation generation must be run after the release tag has been made
and pushed.

Documentation updates always go on the **master** branch.

* Checkout the master branch.

* Edit `etc/apidocmenu.md` and add the released version in the 'mongocxx'
  column following the established pattern.  If this is a major release
  (x.y.0), revise the entire document as needed.
    * If revised substantially, also edit `docs/content/index.md` and `README.md` to match.

* Edit `etc/generate-all-apidocs.pl` and add the new release version to
  the `@DOC_TAGS` array, following the established pattern.

* Edit `docs/content/mongocxx-v3/installation.md` and update `Step 3` to
  reflect the latest version to download.  (Generally, search for the last
  version number and update it.)

* Commit these changes.

`git commit -am "Prepare to generate r3.0.2 release documentation"`

* Ensure you have `doxygen` and `hugo` installed and up to date.  `hugo`
  must be at least version v0.16.

* Change to the repo top directory and run `git clean -dxf` to clear out
  all extraneous files.

* Change to the `build` directory and run cmake as you usually would.

* To test documentation generation without deploying, run the `docs` build
  target.  E.g. `ninja docs`.  If this works, your documentation tools are
  correctly installed.  Note that this only generates hugo docs and a
  single set of doxygen docs for the current repo.  To test generation of
  all docs for all tags, use the `doxygen-all` target and be prepared to
  wait a while.

* To generate and deploy documentation to GitHub Pages, execute both the
  `hugo-deploy` and `doxygen-deploy` targets.  The doxygen build will take
  a long time.

* If the release was *not* a release-candidate, update symlinks
    * Check out the "gh-pages" branch and `git pull` the deployed docs.
    * If the release was *not* a release-candidate, update the
      api/mongocxx-v3 symlink to point to the newly released version.  If a
      major version bump has occurred, revise the symlink structure as
      needed.  Make sure 'current' always points to a *symlink* tracking
      the latest release branch.
    * Commit and push the symlink change:  `git commit -am "Update symlink for r3.0.3"`

* Wait a minute and verify the docs site has been updated.

* Return to the original branch.

## File a DOCS ticket

If there is any change to the driver-server compatibility matrix or
language compatibility matrix file a [DOCS
ticket](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DOCS/).  This generally will only
apply to an x.y.0 release.
