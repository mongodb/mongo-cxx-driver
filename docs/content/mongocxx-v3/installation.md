# Installing the mongocxx driver

## Prerequisites

- Any standard Unix platform, or Windows 7 SP1+
- A compiler that suports C++11 (gcc, clang, or Visual Studio)
- CMake 3.2 or later
- boost headers (optional)

We currently test the driver with the following configurations:

&nbsp; |   Linux  |    OS X     |      Windows
-------|----------|-------------|-------------------
 clang |   3.8    | 7.0 (Apple) |        -
 gcc   | 4.8, 5.4 |     -       |        -
 VS    |   n/a    |    n/a      | 14 (2015) Update 3
 boost |    -     |   1.5.3     |      1.6.0

Versions older the the ones listed may not work and are not
supported; use them at your own risk.

Versions newer than the ones listed above should work; if you
have problems, please file a bug report via
[JIRA](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CXX/).

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the latest version of the MongoDB C driver.

The mongocxx driver builds on top of the MongoDB C driver.

* For mongocxx-3.2.x, libmongoc 1.9.2 or later is required.
* For mongocxx-3.1.[0-3], libmongoc 1.5.0 or later is required.
* For mongocxx-3.1.4+, libmongoc 1.7.0 or later is required.
* For mongocxx-3.0.x, we recommend the last 1.4.x version of libmongoc

Unless you know that your package manager offers a high-enough version, you
will need to download and build from the source code. Get a tarball from
the [C Driver releases](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases)
page.

Follow the instructions for building from a tarball at
[Installing libmongoc](http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/installing.html).

If you need static C++ driver libraries and you are configuring the C
driver with the `./configure` script, you must pass the `--enable-static`
configure option when building libbson/libmongoc.

### Step 2: Choose a C++17 polyfill

The mongocxx driver uses the C++17 features `std::optional` and
`std::string_view`. To compile the mongocxx driver for pre-C++17, you
must choose one of the following implementations for these features:

   MNMLSTC/core (*default for non-Windows platforms*)
     Select with `-DBSONCXX_POLY_USE_MNMLSTC=1`.  **NOTE**: This option
     vendors a header-only installation of MNMLSTC/core into the bsoncxx
     library installation and will therefore download MLNMLSTC from GitHub
     during the build process. If you already have an available version of
     MNMLSTC on your system, you can avoid the download step by using
     `-DBSONCXX_POLY_USE_SYSTEM_MNMLSTC`.

   Boost (*default for Windows platforms*)
     Select with `-DBSONCXX_POLY_USE_BOOST=1`. This is currently the
     only option if you are using MSVC.

   `std::experimental`
     Select with `-DBSONCXX_POLY_USE_STD_EXPERIMENTAL=1`. If your
     toolchain's standard library provides `optional` and
     `string_view` in the namespace `std::experimental`, you can use
     this option. Be aware that your standard library's 
     `std::experimental` implementation may change over time,
     breaking binary compatibility in unexpected ways. Note that this
     polyfill is *not* recommended and is unsupported.

Most users should be fine sticking with the default. However, if you
have an existing application which makes heavy use of one of the
available libraries, you may prefer to build the mongocxx driver
against the same library.

**DO NOT** change your project's polyfill if you need to create a
stable binary interface.

### Step 3: Download the latest version of the mongocxx driver.

To get the source via git, the `releases/stable` branch will track the most
recent stable release. For example, to work from a shallow checkout of the
stable release branch:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.git \
    --branch releases/stable --depth 1
cd mongo-cxx-driver/build
```

If you prefer to download a tarball, look on the [mongocxx
releases](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/releases) page for a
link to the release tarball for the version you wish you install.  For
example, to download version 3.2.0:

```sh
curl -OL https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/archive/r3.2.0.tar.gz
tar -xzf r3.2.0.tar.gz
cd mongo-cxx-driver-r3.2.0/build
```

Make sure you change to the `build` directory of whatever source tree you
obtain.

### Step 4: Configure the driver

On Unix systems, `libmongoc` installs into `/usr/local` by default.  To
configure `mongocxx` for installation into `/usr/local` as well, use the
following `cmake` command:

(***NOTE***: The trailing `..` below is important!  Don't omit it.)

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
```

`/usr/local` may be replaced with the directory that `libmongoc` was
installed to.

If you need to install `mongocxx` into a different directory than the
directory where `libmongoc` is installed, you must instruct `cmake` on
how to find the `libmongoc` installation directory.  The procedure for
doing so varies between mongocxx versions:

- Users building `mongocxx` versions 3.2.x or newer should use
  `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to specify the `libmongoc` installation directory.
  For example (make sure to replace `/your/cdriver/prefix` and
  `/your/cxxdriver/prefix` with the prefix used for installing the C
  driver and the desired installation prefix, respectively):

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/cxxdriver/prefix \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/your/cdriver/prefix ..
```

- *Note*: If you need multiple paths in `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, separate them with
  a semicolon like this: `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/your/cdriver/prefix;/some/other/path"`

- Users building `mongocxx` versions 3.1.x and 3.0.x should specify the
  `libmongoc` installation directory by using the `-DLIBMONGOC_DIR` and
  `-DLIBBSON_DIR` options to `cmake`.  See the following example, which
  assumes that both `libmongoc` and `libbson` are installed into
  `/your/cdriver/prefix`:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/cxxdriver/prefix
    -DLIBMONGOC_DIR=/your/cdriver/prefix
    -DLIBBSON_DIR=/your/cdriver/prefix ..
```

Remember: to select a polyfill, pass the option to `cmake`. For example,
to select the Boost polyfill, substitute the `cmake` line with
the following:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBSONCXX_POLY_USE_BOOST=1 \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
```

On Windows, here's an example of how to configure for MSVC (assuming
libmongoc and libbson are in `c:\mongo-c-driver` as given in the
[mongoc Windows installation
instructions](http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/installing.html#building-windows)
and boost is in `c:\local\boost_1_59_0`:

```sh
'C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake\bin\cmake.exe' -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64"
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\mongo-cxx-driver
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=c:\mongo-c-driver
    -DBOOST_ROOT=c:\local\boost_1_59_0
```

`mongocxx` builds shared libraries by default.  This is the recommended
build setting for novice users.

- Note for users of mongocxx 3.2.x and newer: advanced users may build
  static libraries, if desired, by specifying `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` to
  CMake. Specifying this option will introduce a dependency on the
  `libmongoc` static libraries (see step 1 above for details on how to
  ensure that these are installed).  Linking an application against both
  shared `libmongoc` and static `mongocxx` is not supported, nor is
  linking against both static `libmongoc` and shared `mongocxx`.

### Step 5: Build and install the driver

If you are using the default MNMLSTC polyfill and are installing to a
directory requiring root permissions, you should install the polyfill with
`sudo` before running `make` so you don't have to run all of `make` with
`sudo`:

```sh
# Only for MNMLSTC polyfill
sudo make EP_mnmlstc_core
```

Once MNMLSTC is installed, or if you are using a different polyfill,
build and install the driver:

```sh
make && sudo make install
```

On Windows, build and install from the command line like this:

```sh
msbuild.exe ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
msbuild.exe INSTALL.vcxproj
```

### Step 6: Test your installation

Save the following source file with the filename `test.cpp`
underneath any directory:

```c++
#include <iostream>

#include <bsoncxx/builder/stream/document.hpp>
#include <bsoncxx/json.hpp>

#include <mongocxx/client.hpp>
#include <mongocxx/instance.hpp>

int main(int, char**) {
    mongocxx::instance inst{};
    mongocxx::client conn{mongocxx::uri{}};

    bsoncxx::builder::stream::document document{};

    auto collection = conn["testdb"]["testcollection"];
    document << "hello" << "world";

    collection.insert_one(document.view());
    auto cursor = collection.find({});

    for (auto&& doc : cursor) {
        std::cout << bsoncxx::to_json(doc) << std::endl;
    }
}
```

#### Compiling with the help of CMake

If you are using CMake for your project, you can use the find_package()
directive to enable compiling and linking against `mongocxx`.  The
find_package() directive will set variables in the current environment
(e.g. `LIBMONGOCXX_INCLUDE_DIRS`, `LIBMONGOCXX_LIBRARIES`, etc.) that need
to be propagated to your build targets.  If you have installed `mongocxx`
or `libmongoc` to a non-standard location on your system, you will need to
set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to the library installation prefix (specified at
build time with `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`) when running `cmake`.

In the `mongocxx` source repository (versions 3.2.x or newer only), see
the directory `examples/projects/mongocxx/cmake` for an example CMake
application which uses the shared library (the default option), and an
example CMake application which uses the static library (advanced users
only).

#### Compiling with the help of pkg-config

Compile the test program above with the following command:

```sh
c++ --std=c++11 test.cpp -o test $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libmongocxx)
```

Advanced users who are using the static library must replace the
`libmongocxx` argument to `pkg-config` above with `libmongocxx-static`
(this requires mongocxx 3.2.x or newer).

If you installed to somewhere not in your pkg-config search path, remember
to set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable first:

```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$MY_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig"
```

#### Compiling without pkg-config or CMake

If you aren't using CMake for your project and you don't have pkg-config
available, you will need to set include and library flags manually on the
command line or in your IDE.

Here's an example expansion of the compilation line above, on a system
where mongocxx and libmongoc are installed in `/usr/local`:

```sh
c++ --std=c++11 test.cpp -o test \
    -I/usr/local/include/mongocxx/v_noabi \
    -I/usr/local/include/bsoncxx/v_noabi \
    -L/usr/local/lib -lmongocxx -lbsoncxx
```

Advanced users only: here is an example expansion on the same system of
the compilation line above when static libraries are being used.  Note
that the preprocessor defines `MONGOCXX_STATIC` and `BSONCXX_STATIC` must
be defined in all source files that include mongocxx headers; failure to
do so will result in difficult-to-diagnose linker errors.

```sh
c++ --std=c++11 test.cpp -o test \
    -DMONGOCXX_STATIC -DBSONCXX_STATIC -DMONGOC_STATIC -DBSON_STATIC \
    -I/usr/local/include/libmongoc-1.0 \
    -I/usr/local/include/libbson-1.0 \
    -I/usr/local/include/mongocxx/v_noabi \
    -I/usr/local/include/bsoncxx/v_noabi \
    -L/usr/local/lib -lmongocxx-static -lbsoncxx-static
    -lmongoc-static-1.0 -lsasl2 -lssl -lcrypto -lbson-static-1.0 -lm -lpthread
```

#### Compiling with MSVC

To compile on MSVC, you will need to setup your project to include all the
necessary include paths, library paths, preprocessor defines, and link
libraries. To do this, you can set these values either by the UI or by
editing the XML `.vcxproj` file directly. To confirm you have everything
setup correctly, here are the `PropertyGroup` and `ItemDefinitionGroup`
settings for a Debug x64 build as an example:

```xml
  <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|x64'">
    <LinkIncremental>true</LinkIncremental>
    <IncludePath>c:\local\boost_1_59_0\;C:\mongo-cxx-driver\include\mongocxx\v_noabi;C:\mongo-cxx-driver\include\bsoncxx\v_noabi;C:\mongo-c-driver\include\libmongoc-1.0;C:\mongo-c-driver\include\libbson-1.0;$(IncludePath)</IncludePath>
    <LibraryPath>c:\mongo-c-driver\lib\;c:\mongo-cxx-driver\lib\;$(LibraryPath)</LibraryPath>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemDefinitionGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|x64'">
    <ClCompile>
      <PrecompiledHeader>Use</PrecompiledHeader>
      <WarningLevel>Level3</WarningLevel>
      <Optimization>Disabled</Optimization>
      <PreprocessorDefinitions>MONGOCXX_STATIC;BSONCXX_STATIC;_DEBUG;_CONSOLE;%(PreprocessorDefinitions)</PreprocessorDefinitions>
      <SDLCheck>true</SDLCheck>
    </ClCompile>
    <Link>
      <SubSystem>Console</SubSystem>
      <GenerateDebugInformation>true</GenerateDebugInformation>
      <AdditionalDependencies>libmongocxx.lib;libbsoncxx.lib;mongoc-static-1.0.lib;bson-1.0.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)</AdditionalDependencies>
    </Link>
  </ItemDefinitionGroup>
```
