## NOTE: The Legacy C++ driver has reached End-Of-Life. Please upgrade to the mongocxx driver.

In the legacy-0.9 development cycle, the mechanism by which the driver is
configured was refactored. Note that these changes *do not apply to
releases on the 26compat branch, or releases pre-dating legacy-0.9.0*.This
page describes the new configuration mechanism and documents the various
configuration options that may be used.

# Configuring the Driver

## The `mongo::client::initialize` function

The `mongo::client::initialize` function, found in file
[`src/mongo/client/init.h`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/blob/legacy/src/mongo/client/init.h)
configures the driver and starts background threads critical to the
functioning of the driver. The function has a single parameter receiving a
`mongo::client::Options` object. If no value is provided, a default
constructed `mongo::client::Options` object is used.

To configure the driver to use non-default parameters, construct a new
`mongo::client::Options` object and use its setter methods to configure the
parameters of interest, and pass this object to
`mongo::client::initialize`.

This method must be called exactly once by your application. Invoke
`mongo::client::initialize` as early as possible in your application
startup phase, before any additional threads have been created. You must
examine the return value of `mongo::client::initialize` and deal with any
returned error appropriately.

## The `mongo::client::terminate` function

When it is time to stop using the client driver, you must terminate its
background tasks and release resources by invoking the
`mongo::client::terminate` function, found in file
[`src/mongo/client/init.h`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/blob/legacy/src/mongo/client/init.h).

The `mongo::client::terminate` function honors a grace period, specified in
milliseconds, and defaulting to 'forever'. The shutdown routine will give
background tasks the selected grace period to terminate cleanly. If they do
not do so, `mongo::client::terminate` will return an error status. If the
returned error status is `ExceededTimeLimit` it is safe to retry the call
to `mongo::client::terminate`. Otherwise, a non-OK return status from
`mongo::client::terminate` represents a permanent failure to shut down the
driver cleanly. Please see the documentation for `mongo::client::terminate`
for additional details. The value of the shutdown grace period may be
changed from its default at driver initialization time by using an
appropriately configured `mongo::client::Options` object.

On some platforms, you may be able to arrange for
`mongo::client::terminate` to be called via an atexit handler. To request
this behavior, see the `setCallShutdownAtExit` option, documented below.

Alternatively, you may use the `mongo::client::GlobalInstance` class, found
in
[`src/mongo/client/init.h`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/blob/legacy/src/mongo/client/init.h),
to instantiate an RAII type that will automatically initialize and
terminate the driver.

## The `mongo::client::Options` class

### Where to find it

Configuration of the driver is managed through a new class, added in the
`legacy-0.9.0` release, called `Options`. This class is hosted in the
`mongo::client` namespace, and is defined in the header
[`mongo/client/options.h`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/blob/legacy/src/mongo/client/options.h).

### Passing options to `mongo::client::initialize`

By default, calling `mongo::client::initialize()` with no parameters is
equivalent to calling `mongo::client::initialize(mongo::client::Options())`
passing a default constructed `mongo::client::Options` object.

Because the `mongo::client::Options` class has setters returning a
`mongo::client::Options&` you can chain together options to easily
configure them at the call site:

```cpp
using mongo::client::initialize;
using mongo::client::Options;

// Configure the mongo C++ client driver, enabling SSL and setting
// the SSL Certificate Authority file to "mycafile".
Status status = initialize(
    Options().setSSLMode(Options::kSSLRequired).setSSLCAFile("mycafile")
);

if (!status.isOK()) {
    // deal with errors
} else {
    // Driver is up in SSL mode.
}
```
### Available Options

#### `Options::callShutdownAtExit` and `Options::setCallShutdownAtExit`

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`
- Semantics: If this option is 'true', then a successful call to
  `mongo::client::initialize` will schedule a call to
  `mongo::client::terminate` with `atexit`. The call to
  `mongo::client::terminate` will be made with the value of
  `mongo::client::Options::current::autoShutdownGracePeriodMillis`


#### `Options::autoShutdownGracePeriodMillis` and `Options::setAutoShutdownGracePeriodMillis`

- Type: `int`, interpreted as milliseconds
- Default: 0 (wait forever)
- Semantics: If `mongo::client::initialize` scheduled a call to
  `mongo::client::terminate` with `atexit`, then that call to
  `mongo::client::terminate` will use the value
  `Options::autoShutdownGracePeriodMillis` when calling
  `mongo::client::terminate`.


#### `Options::setDefaultLocalThresholdMillis` and `Options::defaultLocalThresholdMillis`

- Type: `int`, interpreted as milliseconds
- Default: 15
- Semantics: TODO

#### `Options::setSSLMode` and `Options::SSLMode`

- Type: [`Options::kSSLEnabled`|`Options:kSSLDisabled`]
- Default: `Options::kSSLDisabled`
- Semantics: If set to `Options:kSSLEnabled` the driver will require SSL
  connections to all mongo servers. If disabled, it will not request SSL.
  Note that if the servers you are connected to are in SSL required mode,
  you may not be able to connect. This value is an enumeration so that we
  may later extend it with a `kSSLPreferred` option, but that is not
  currently implemented.

#### `Options::setFIPSMode` and `Options::FIPSMode`

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`
- Semantics: If true, will attempt to use FIPS-140 validated crypto if
  supported by the crypto library currently in use.

#### `Options::setSSLCAFile` and `Options::SSLCAFile`

- Type: `std::string`
- Default: `""`
- Semantics: This flag only has an effect if `Options::current::SSLMode` is
  `Options::kSSLRequired`. If set, it specifies a file containing the
  certificate authority file to use. See the [MongoDB SSL
  documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/tutorial/configure-ssl/#set-up-mongod-and-mongos-with-ssl-certificate-and-key)
  for additional information on the CA file.

#### `Options::setSSLPemKeyFile` and `Options::SSLPEMKeyFile`

- Type: `std::string`
- Default: `""`
- Semantics: This flag only has an effect if `Options::current::SSLMode` is
  `Options::kSSLRequired`. If set, it specifies a file containing the SSL
  PEM key file to use. See the [MongoDB SSL
  documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/tutorial/configure-ssl/#set-up-mongod-and-mongos-with-ssl-certificate-and-key)
  for additional information on the PEM key file.

#### `Options::setSSLPemKeyPassword` and `Options::SSLPEMKeyPassword`

- Type: `std::string`
- Default: `""`
- Semantics: This flag only has an effect if `Options::current::SSLMode` is
  `Options::kSSLRequired`, and is only meaningful if a PEM key file has
  been set with `Options::setSSLPEMKeyFile`. If set, it specifies the
  password to be used to decrypt the SSL PEM key file specified with
  `Options::setSSLPEMKeyFile`. See the [MongoDB SSL
  documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/tutorial/configure-ssl/#set-up-mongod-and-mongos-with-ssl-certificate-and-key)
  for additional information on the PEM key file password.

#### `Options::setSSLCRLFile` and `Options::SSLCRLFile`

- Type: `std::string`
- Default: `""`
- Semantics: This flag only has an effect if `Options::current::SSLMode` is
  `Options::kSSLRequired`. If set, it specifies the file to use as the SSL
  certificate revocation list. See the [MongoDB SSL
  documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/tutorial/configure-ssl/#set-up-mongod-and-mongos-with-ssl-certificate-and-key)
  for additional information on the certificate revocation list file.

#### `Options::setSSAllowInvalidCertificates` and `Options::SSLAllowInvalidCertificates`

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`
- Semantics: This flag only has an effect if `Options::current::SSLMode` is
  `Options::kSSLRequired`. Setting this option to `true` suppresses
  validation of certificates. In other words, invalid certificates will be
  accepted.

#### `Options::setLogAppenderFactory` and `Options::logAppenderFactory`

- Type: `Options::LogAppenderFactory`
- Default: none
- Semantics: Use `setLogAppenderFactory` if you want to configure a custom
  appender to listen to the driver's internally logged messages. Setting
  such a factory will enable logging and relay logged messages to whatever
  appender you provide a factory method for. An example of how to do this
  can be found
  [here](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/blob/legacy/src/mongo/client/examples/loggingTest.cpp).
  You may only configure one appender through startup options.

#### `Options::setMinLoggedSeverity` and `Options::minLoggedSeverity'

- Type: `logger::LogSeverity`
- Default: `LogSeverity::Log()`
- Semantics: When providing a custom log appender (see above) use this to
  set the minimum severity level of logged messages. Messages that are of
  less importance than the level you provide will not be logged.

#### `Options::setValidateObjects` and `Options::validateObjects`

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`
- Semantics: If enabled, the client library will run BSON validation on
  data returned from the server to ensure that the returned data is valid
  BSON. Note that there is a performance cost to doing so.

## Caveats

- You must call `mongo::client::initialize` before using the driver. You
  may only call `mongo::client::initialize` once.

- Configuration of the driver is global. You may access a `const` reference
  to the current global configuration state of the driver by calling
  `mongo::client::Options::current`. If called before entering `main`, the
  values returned by accessors of the `Options` object returned by
  `Options::current` are indeterminate. If called after `main` but before
  calling `mongo::client::initialize`, a default constructed instance of
  the `Options` class will be returned. If called after
  `mongo::client::initialize`, the value returned by `Options::current`
  will reflect any customized `Options` instance passed to
  `mongo::client::initialize`.

- Configuration of the driver is not synchronized, and you may only invoke
  `mongo::client::initialize` once. We strongly recommend that you call
  `mongo::client::initialize` as early as possible in `main` or your
  application startup code, preferably before creating any additional
  threads.
