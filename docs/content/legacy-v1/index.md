## NOTE: The Legacy C++ driver has reached End-Of-Life. Please upgrade to the mongocxx driver.

# The legacy C++ driver

The legacy C++ driver builds on x86 and x86-64 architectures for Linux, Mac
OS X, Windows, FreeBSD and Solaris.

The legacy C++ driver library includes a bson package that
implements the BSON specification (see http://www.bsonspec.org). This
library can be used standalone for object serialization and deserialization
even when one is not using MongoDB at all.

Releases of legacy drivers have version numbers like v0.x.y and v1.x.y.

(Note: version numbers like v0.0-26compat-2.x.y refer to a different,
deprecated C++ driver branch.)
