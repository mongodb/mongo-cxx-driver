      <description>If you contribute to the C++ driver, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to test your changes. The driver comes with a number of tests to ensure its functionality and performance. There are a few different kinds of tests within the driver&amp;rsquo;s codebase.
Note: if you are running OS X Mavericks or above, you may need to include the --osx-version-min=10.9 flag to the commands below.
Note: The 26compat branch differs from the instructions below as follows:</description>

      <description>Tests for the C++11 driver use Catch, a testing framework for C++.
Each class in the driver has a corresponding file in src/mongocxx/test. Because the new driver wraps libmongoc, we prefer to mock and test the behavior of individual classes rather than test end-to-end behavior of operations against a running mongod. In other words, these are unit tests rather than integration tests.
We also have integration tests for this driver in test/collection.</description>
