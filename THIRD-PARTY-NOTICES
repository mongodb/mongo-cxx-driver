4) License Notice for JsonCpp
-----------------------------

The JsonCpp library's source code, including accompanying documentation, 
tests and demonstration applications, are licensed under the following
conditions...

The author (Baptiste Lepilleur) explicitly disclaims copyright in all 
jurisdictions which recognize such a disclaimer. In such jurisdictions, 
this software is released into the Public Domain.

In jurisdictions which do not recognize Public Domain property (e.g.
Germany as of 2010), this software is Copyright (c) 2007-2010 by Baptiste
Lepilleur, and is released under the terms of the MIT License (see below).

In jurisdictions which recognize Public Domain property, the user of this 
software may choose to accept it either as 1) Public Domain, 2) under the 
conditions of the MIT License (see below), or 3) under the terms of dual 
Public Domain/MIT License conditions described here, as they choose.

The MIT License is about as close to Public Domain as a license can get, and is
described in clear, concise terms at:

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License

The full text of the MIT License follows:

    ========================================================================
    Copyright (c) 2007-2010 Baptiste Lepilleur

    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person
    obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation
    files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without
    restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy,
    modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies
    of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
    included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND

    BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN
    ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN
    CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
    SOFTWARE.
    ========================================================================
    (END LICENSE TEXT)

The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial
software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the
minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice
and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the
Public Domain "license" you can re-license your copy using whatever
license you like.

5) License Notice for RestClient

6) License Notice for the TZ Database
-------------------------------------

The tzcode library is published as part of the TZ Database by IANA at
https://www.iana.org/time-zones

Ownership is described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp175.txt:

    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF document.
    Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work that is in the
    public domain, and is intended to remain in the public domain.
    Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply to the TZ
    Database or contributions that individuals make to it.  Should any
    claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database, the
    organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in this
    RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF, currently
    ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court orders.  No
    ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the
    database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the database
    or code waives all rights to future claims in that contribution or in
    the TZ Database.

NOTE: Per restriction 2 above, this file has been altered by MongoDB as
follows:

1. The functions md5_init, md5_append, and md5_finish have been moved into
the 'mongo' namespace and given C++ linkage, so that static archives of
this library may be combined with other libraries that expose functions of
the same name.
